# Minimum Recurring Payments

## What's This All About?

These are my thoughts, as I get my head wrapped around how to handle recurring payments in web apps, using Rails and Active Merchant to send customer data over to Braintree.

At the moment, these will just be loosely-gathered thoughts. I might add some code in at some point, but we'll see. I might also just use Freemium or another library built for this general purpose. I'd really like it to be as simple as possible, though. Just enough to work.
